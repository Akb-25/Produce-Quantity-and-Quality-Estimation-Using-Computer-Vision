This project is a produce estimator and quality predictor tool that utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection to count the number of apples in an image and predict their ripeness. It provides an estimation of the produce count and quality based on the detected apples' ripeness level.

Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate detection of apples in the provided images.
Produce Counting: Counts the number of apples detected in the image.
Ripeness Prediction: Predicts the ripeness of each detected apple.
Quality Estimation: Provides an overall quality estimation of the produce based on ripeness levels.
